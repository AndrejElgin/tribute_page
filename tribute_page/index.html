            Young Albert was attracted by sport but tuberculosis cut this plans short. Because of tuberculosis Camus decided to live near the Alps in a secluded area.
            He wrote a couple of theatre plays, although he is not famous for them.
            One of the most significant contributions that he made was his role as an editor of newspaper <i>Combat</i>. It was a resistence newspaper in France occupied by Nazi Germany.
            In 1942 his first novel(<i>the Outsider</i>) was published. It was well percieved by public at the time. He also wrote a couple of philosophical essays.
